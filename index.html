      <p>Hi there! You've stumbled upon my website where I keep all the good stuff I make to trick people into wanting to work with me. I'm a full-stack web developer, so I keep a tech blog on cool things I find on the interwebs and my learning experiences
        I gain through working with people, going to meet-ups, wrestling with new tech, etc. You can also check out my projects here and on Github.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I also do some experimental art and music. Just like I love learning new things and applying them in web development, I do the same thing with art and music. Recently, I've been playing around with different mediums. I used to be
        a pencil/pen and paper person, but I've expanded to using chalk and paint on cardboard, wood, etc. It's been really fun finding out what you can do with different materials.</p>
      <p>For music, it's the same way. I have a little more background with music as my art has been mainly an independent journey, but I have many talented friends who have helped me navigate the world of audio processing and hardware. I started out with
        just a USB mic, an acoustic guitar, and way too much self-consciousness about recording music. I've since then gotten over that and have expanded my music explorations to DJ-ing, mixing, producing, and recording music in a more analytical way.
      </p>
